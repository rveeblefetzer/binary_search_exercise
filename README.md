# binary_search_exercise

This repo contains two scripts, one in Python and one in Ruby, that aim to illustrate the efficiency of binary search.

The Python script is borrowed and amended from the book book [_Grokking Algorithms_](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230) by @egonSchiele.
The Ruby adaptaion was ported by me. Both will break on bad input, and there's no tests. I'll change that when time allows, or if someone submits pull requests.
